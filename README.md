# miniDSP2x4HD-PyGI

Experimental python tool and code collection to monitor and control the MiniDSP 2x4 HD. Port from very old DSP "SignalRanger MK1" based audio processing. Work in progress.

Using code from a hacked/expanded port of the wire protocol to python by github.com/markubiak/python3-minidsp

Execute minidsp_monitor.py with python3 to bing up a a selection of tools to minitor In and Out Levels plus have control for Config/Input Source and Volume+Gain.

Scope (not yet used here) and Meter python gtk widgets are borrowed from my own "GXSM" project at SourceForge.
